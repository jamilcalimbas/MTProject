         <p class="Dumadara">  
           The Dumadara Festival is a vibrant celebration held annually in Barangay Davila, a coastal community in Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte. Rooted in both tradition and faith, the festival reflects the people’s deep connection to the sea and their gratitude for its blessings. At the heart of the festivity is the dumadara, a kind of fish that plays a significant role in the livelihood and diet of the locals. By dedicating a festival to this fish, the people of Davila not only celebrate a bountiful fishing season but also highlight the importance of their seafaring culture. The festival is more than just a feast; it is an expression of thanksgiving. It coincides with the month of May, which is traditionally dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Catholic practice. Thus, the Dumadara Festival blends religious devotion with cultural traditions, making it a unique celebration of faith and community life. A thanksgiving mass is held as a central part of the activities, emphasizing the people’s acknowledgment of divine providence in their daily lives and work at sea.
