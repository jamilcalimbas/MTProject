        <p><b>Pasuquin Legend </b></p>
        <p class="history1">
          According to folk legend, Pasuquin was first settled by two groups of people, the Itneg and the Ibaliw at a place called Nagrebkan, meaning the place of the vanquished. When the first Spanish missionaries arrived, they still encountered some from the defeated group, whose names were entered in Spanish documents as Ibaloi.
          The Augustinians started evangelizing in Pasuquin in 1599. The visita, under the patronage of Santiago Apostol, was recorded in Bacarra until Pasuquin became an independent parish in 1784. The town flourished despite attacks from Chinese ships and Moros as forests were cleared for farmlands. A salt industry in the coastal barrios developed in addition to fishing, giving rise to the name “paasokan” (smoky place), later evolving into Pasuquin.
          During the American colonial era, Pasuquin’s prosperity increased. Its agriculture thrived, and the famous Pasuquin biscocho became well known. The Japanese Occupation brought hardship, as the school and church were used as headquarters and the Spanish-era church was destroyed. After independence in 1946, Pasuquin regained its prosperity. A feldspar mine was developed, roads and bridges were improved, and sandy beaches became popular resorts. By the 1970s, Pasuquin had grown into one of the richest towns in Ilocos Norte, a tribute to the resilience of its people.

        <p><b>Pasuquin in the Colonial Era and Modern Times</b></p>
        <p class="history1">
           Pasuquin’s history continued to develop through the colonial period and into the modern era. When Ilocos Norte was declared a province in 1818, Pasuquin was among its original municipalities. The town’s economy grew steadily through farming and salt-making, activities that became central to the people’s livelihood. With the arrival of the Americans, agriculture expanded to include crops such as rice, tobacco, corn, and sugar cane, while the town also became famous for its delicacies, particularly the Pasuquin biscocho.
           World War II, however, brought difficulties to the community. Japanese soldiers turned the local church and school buildings into garrisons, and the Spanish-era church was left in ruins. Despite these hardships, Pasuquin was able to recover after independence. Roads, bridges, and industries were developed, and salt-making and fishing remained important. Today, Pasuquin thrives not only because of its natural resources but also because of the resilience and faith of its people. Its history stands as a testament to the community’s enduring strength and unity
